                            <p> Hello, I’m looking to buy the Official Guide Bundle from Amazon. However when I go to purchase, Amazon says that the new 2020 version will be available May 7. Is the new version worth waiting for? That’s almost 2 weeks of precious study time from now. Thanks in advance. Download Or Read (https://hendrixpake-x.blogspot.com/?book=1119507677). Hi I know this might be viewed as wrong by many people but does someone have link to the gmat official guide 2018 or 2019, or have it in e-copy and willing to share it with me. That would be extremely helpful Thanks. Hi, I have a book copy of the GMAT Official Guide 2018, and the verbal and quant. Does anyone know where I can purchase a bundle for an e-book copy? I have looked on mba.com (https://mba.com) and they only have 2019. I also saw a copy on e-books, but they are all separate. Would appreciate if anyone can help! Edit: Anyone who wants a copy of what I got, DM your email. Will send it tonight or tomorrow night. 
I'm studying for the GRE and started doing the GMAT Problem solving questions as per Magoosh's suggestion as extra practice. I came across this question and don't quite understand how to solve it despite the explanation. The problem in question: https://i.redd.it/loi71wrq2w621.jpg Official guide's explanation: https://i.redd.it/z03xmt4t2w621.jpg My wrong initial interpretation of how to solve the question: https://i.redd.it/peek4jeu2w62. https://gmatclub.com/forum/gmac-official-guides-the-master-directory-links-240610.html. You can buy the 2018 edition on Kindle, but not 2019. You can buy the electronic version through efficientlearning.com (https://efficientlearning.com) but I'm not sure if that will allow you to read on Kindle. I'm also not sure if you're able to buy the hard copy AND the eBooks at the same time. Ideally, I'd like both the hard copies and eBook. Any help on these questions would be helpful. Thanks. As per title. i'll try to keep this as simple as possible; Is the GMAT OG sufficient for studying for the GMAT? Do I need any other supplemental reading material? I plan to pair the OG with a physical prep class as well as a tutor. I am just wondering if as far as reading material goes, will this be enough? There seems to be study material but it looks mostly like practice questions. Note: I am 2 years out of college, working in finance, I don't believe I have any major knowledge Hi all, Well I just started looking into taking the GMAT today. From my research it seems that it doesn't really matter what version you get as long as it's 2013+, but I just read that the format for the GMAT has changed (~30 minutes shorter) as of April 2018. Did some digging and haven't found the answer to this question but I'm wondering if I should wait for the 2019 OG or if the 17/18 OG's would still be sufficient. Thanks in advance.
