                            <p> Hi all, I was redirected here from r/space, hopefully you guys can help me out. gtHi all! gtI have a Celestron telescope that I've always wanted to be able to use, but I've never been able to figure out how to precisely aim it. My question is: How do you aim a telescope accurately? gtI assume it has something to do with degrees of cardinal directions? The telescope I have is a PowerSeeker 127EQ. Thanks in advance. Hi friends , I need to know the difference between the different EQs mounts available. I want to buy one in the future and need to know about them(for example, the difference between EQ1 and EQ6 ) Thanks. I am looking at the Celestron Evolution series and they seem to only offer their EdgeHD glass in the 8" version. They also sell a 9.25" version with their normal glass. For someone who is not going to do astrophotography would it make more sense to get the 9.25" or is the EdgeHD so impressive that I should get the smaller 8" that has it? I know the EdgeHD makes the stars look great at the edges but wasn't sure if it's overall general improvement would be worth getting a small aperture scope. I'm thinking of getting (another) telescope for travel, I have it down to a few options, as well as a mount. Mount: iOptron (https://www.optcorp.com/ioptron-smarteq-pro-equatorial-computerized-mount-with-case.html) Telescope: Option 1 (https://www.optcorp.com/stellarvue-access-80mm-super-ed-2-5-sv-focuser-d1029ed-case.html) Telescope: Option 2 (https://www.astronomics.com/astro-tech-at80edt-f6-ed-triplet-refractor-ota_p20307.aspx) Telescope: Option 3 (https://www.optcorp.com/explore-sci. Hi folks! I'm currently living near downtown Nashville and am selling my home and moving to the country. I'm moving from an area that is a 10 on a light pollution scale to one that is a 5 or 6. I will have access to a grass field about 200 yards away with about 150 degree views of the sky all around. One portion of the field has a large concrete pad on it but it has a restricted field of view to the north (tree line very close) and I have concerns about how quickly it will cool to near ambient. 
A local thrift store is selling this for 0. Is it worth it if I'm interested in getting in to astrophotography? It's a Meade but I don't see a model number. http://i.imgur.com/qLiIPWW.jpg. I am stuck in between 50-50. Keeps going from 60-40 to 40-60, then back to 50-50. My thoughts: -The 8SE has a much larger aperture, thus giving me a better view of objects, BUT is has a very crappy Altazimuth mount, so no exposures over what, 30 seconds? -The C6, has a very STURDY CG-5 mount, shots for longer than 30 seconds, but smaller aperture. ------------- I have to think, would I like AP more than just viewing the sky? I can't find any sketches of what the difference is between 8inch.

Hi all! I was planning on posting this a bit sooner, but got occupied with life. This is my first post, so bear with me a bit if I get something wrong. This is going to be quite a big list of 88 games, as I mindlessly purchased bundles off Humble for a few years a while back. I finally figured I might as well give them away to people who are interested in playing them, as I'm either not going to play them, or I already own them. There is a little bit of everything, some triple A games # The New Dune Adaptation Filming has Officially Begun (https://i.redd.it/i446dgw9nxm21.jpg)! Hey folks, seeing as how there are so many posts regarding the movie regularly hitting the front page of this subreddit - often with the same questions and answers being repeated in the comments - I decided to put together something a little more comprehensive. For those you of who have yet to read/finish the book, I've kept this post spoiler free but I can't promise the same for the comments. I test drove the Kia Stinger GT with RWD on Sunday. I got the the Kia dealership and was in a Stinger within 2 minutes. I took a test drive and fell in love, I got to take it around the swooping autoplex roads and then 3 exits on the highway. The sales guy was an older no sales pressure guy. Showed me all the options in every trim and had answers for everything. I got home and I was still smiling. I want to buy, but want more of a down payment. With the Tesla Model 3 coming out with a simila. I posted on here a little while ago asking for help finding the original Clarity Live album booklet. In my memory it included a track by track breakdown of the album. I think that my memory was wrong. I was spurred into searching for the breakdown afresh today.and I found it! This is from an archived page on the band's website and may have been an email campaign to fans. It was published in 2009 for the 10th anniversary of the album. amp#x200B; https://web.archive.org/web/2009071620.

For the duration of Season 16, all heroes and builds will enjoy the passive effect of the Ring of Royal Grandeur.
